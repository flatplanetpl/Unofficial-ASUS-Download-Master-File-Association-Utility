Unofficial ASUS Download Master File Association Utility
========================================================
######Associate Magnet links with ASUS Download Master.

#####Use this program at your own risk.

#####I am not responsible for any router/harddrive problems you may experiance.


This application was designed to replace ASUS’s official Download Master. The reason for developing it was that I only needed Magnet support, and the official Download Master loads an entire web-browser to pass the URI to the router.
This application sends the Magnet URI in a simple GET request to the router, then closes itself again.
