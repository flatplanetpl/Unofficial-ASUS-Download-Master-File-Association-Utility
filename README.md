Unofficial ASUS Download Master File Association Utility
========================================================

###### Associate Magnet links with ASUS Download Master.

##### Use this program at your own risk.

##### I am not responsible for any software/hardware problems you may experience.


This application was designed to replace ASUS's official Download Master. The reason for developing it was that I only needed Magnet support, and the official Download Master loads an entire web-browser to pass the URI to the router.
This application sends the Magnet URI in a simple GET request to the router, then closes itself again.

###### Prerequisites:

.NET Framework 4.5

ASUSWRT Download Master

Latest router firmware (tested using Download Master ver. 3.1.0.88)


###### FAQ:

Q: Does it also support HTTP, FTP, .Torrent, .NZB, ed2k?

A: No, for local file support please use the official Download Master from ASUS.
